							This project is a study in understanding the power
							of food and narrative through a series in
							photography. I approached my photography in a way
							that did more than capture products for quick visual
							payoffs to garner clicks to buy. My end goal was to
							create a message that’s more emotive and suggestive
							by connecting to the media consumer in subtle ways.
						</p>
						<p class="text-black-50">
							I am a Designer and Photographer with an interest in
							strategy and a love of story. I work in a
							fast-paced, data, sales, and results-oriented
							environment with tight deadlines. The industry gives
							little time to using stories in a strategic sense
							that has layered complexity. I believe a more
							creative use of strategy has enormous room for
							growth. This project explores storytelling through
							design and photography with layered complexity while
							using elements of strategy.

							As evidenced by the sudden growth of long-form
							serial narrative in television's new Golden age and
							the interconnectedness of movie franchises, media
							consumers have an increased thirst for deeper
							narrative tones. With layered cues and easter eggs
							used to tell larger story arcs society is coming to
							expect more from media and the stories that are
							told. Food is at the heart of many of these stories
							and can carry themes and nuance well. It can be
							complex, layered, evocative, and beautiful. It is
							also an elemental human need and experience.
							<br />
							<br />
							I see longer-form storytelling elements as a
							stronger form of strategy with community resonance
							and creating conversation. It can be a means to get
							people invested and cultivate awareness through
							these stories. It can be used to promote
							conversations of historic and contemporary issues of
							difference with empathy, and even help support an
							acceptance of difference. By making these a part of
							design through the use of layered storytelling and
							strategy they could be available in people’s
							everyday lives and for this reason, we need a
							variety of approaches. This takes an idea of social
							issues and presents it to people not always touched
							by these social issues themselves but begin by
							noticing and looking.
							<br />
							<br />
						</p>
						<p class="text-black-50">
							A successful medium in encompassing these approaches
							is film. It is a cornerstone of storytelling with a
							rich history in visual vocabulary. Using that as
							inspiration I began with a study of my favorite food
							scenes and how they communicate through food, color,
							and composition. To give some examples, I looked at
							Rocky and his breakfast of champions’ raw eggs in a
							glass. The Breakfast Club’s Saturday detention lunch
							depicting class and lifestyle. And the racism of
							Sal’s pizzeria and the food economy of the
							neighborhood in “Do the Right Thing”.

						<h4>
							Themes for
							<i>The Bell Jar</i>
						</h4>
						<p class="text-black-50">
							I focused on the suffocation of social identities
							and the constraints they create. To be accepted and
							succeed, one must become homogeneous to specific
							mandates of identity. As in
							<i>The Bell Jar</i>, even though it appeared as
							though there were two possibilities presented,
							career and domesticity, the only choice was the
							perpetuation of motherhood. There are many metaphors
							in the Bell Jar relating to the consequences of
							indulging in independence and freedom. To quickly
							set the stage, Esther Greenwood, the principal
							character is being hosted at a glamorous lunch by
							Ladies Day magazine along with her fellow interns.
							<br />
							<br />
							I wrote a thematic brief to keep the work focused
							and look back to as a reference point.
							<br />
							<br />
							<b
								>Young female interns are wined and dined at the
								Ladies’ Day Magazine luncheon with rich decadent
								foods like avocados stuffed with crabmeat salad
								and chicken slathered with caviar. After this
								indulgent and performative lunch, they all get
								devastating food poisoning. Referring to the
								feminine theme that glamour and gluttony are
								dark rewards for repression and conformity.
								Repression in this book also takes the form of
								self-destructive acts. The characters relieve
								their shadow sides with parties of “wild and
								abandon” and are later punished for it. Running
								from the perfectionism it takes to conform and
								succeed takes dark turns.</b
							>
							<br />
							<br />
							With this theme in mind, I created a moodboard to
							guide the shoot.

						<h4>
							Themes for
							<i>Circe</i>
						</h4>
						<p class="text-black-50">
							<i>Circe</i> is a witch taken from an archetypal
							hero’s journey that’s been a part of our culture as
							far back as Homer’s Odyssey and brings it into a
							contemporary feminine framework. The heroine’s
							journey is told with male perspective. The key idea
							is how in a masculine ideal based society, one could
							use the blueprint of work to find a novel way
							out/through and make peace with the identity of
							“other”. It is a story of finding pieces of
							empowerment in an epic feminine journey.
							<br />
							<br />
							<b
								>A heroine’s journey through a universal male
								landscape of the Roman myth follows the general
								leads of feminine constraints. Circe is placed
								in exile as the rebellious feminine. Yet she
								uses that space, outside of society, to define
								her own identity. The witch empowers herself
								through intention and work. Transformation is
								not only reflected through external spells of
								witchcraft for Circe but more powerfully with
								internal evolution.</b
							>b>
							<br />
							<br />
							For Circe’s visuals, I reached into the colors of
							the story and time period. The palette reflects soil
							and dirt, a timeless organic material and an
							archetypal ally of feminine power. Vanitas paintings
							were also an inspiration, they’re “a symbolic work
							of art showing the transience of life, the futility
							of pleasure, and the certainty of death” popular in
							the 16th and 17th century. I chose food that would
							be available to the Mediterranean region and then
							explored historical depictions of eating for
							stylistic inspiration, which I found reliant on
							freshness and the magical nature of herbs. I used
							light and shadow to invoke a naturalistic setting.

							With defined themes and visual scaffolding, I left

							wooden dishes and aged metal for Circe. I bought
							some colored green glass to carry the palette and
							add variety. For the Bell Jar, I studied table
							settings of the time and noticed also with working
							in fine dining for a bit of my life, that traditions
							don’t change that much. Like fine dining, traditions
							are only further embedded. So I went with classic
							white linens to further feature the food and its
							decadence. I found plates with gold edging and
							jadeite side plates to echo the greens. The wine
							glasses and glass were chosen to create added
							dimension in the shadows.

							Circe’s feast was on a long folding banquet table in
							front of my garage with the background held in place
							using tall boards. I set the table in line with the
							light and shadow underneath the trees as I hopped
							over lily beds. Bees and flies rested on the fruit
							every now and then. It was a full day. The spell
							work shoot that proceeds the feast was shot during
							the golden hour of the evening on the autumnal
							equinox. The light was breathtaking but moved
							quickly and made for a rapid timeline.

							The Bell Jar was shot in my living room in front of
							a picture window with a strobe and a speed light. I
							asked my family to provide a constant clear runway
							from the living room to the kitchen. This was much
							harder than the other shoot because my sweet
							children flocked around - talking and talking and
							asking questions. The pandemic continues to create
							resourceful working solutions. Since I have little
							access to people, the few shots I wanted with hands
							used a tripod and a remote button with help to
							focus.
							<br />
							<br />
							After the photo shoots and subsequent editing, I
							reached out to several reviewers for feedback. All
							had some tie to photography and or design. The
							reviews were helpful, forcing me to reevaluate some
							decisions I had made, reinforcing others, and
							broaching questions with myself about the project.
							<br />
							<br />
							Some of the most resonant self-generated questions
							from the incoming feedback were: What are universal
							elements and how are they defined? Is this an
							assumption of homogeneous culture? Can one distill
							abstraction into a loose formula? What gives it
							authority and consistency? How can you clearly
							communicate what you want the viewer to take away
							without being explicit? How can I embed emotions in
							the visual? How can I structure a story and execute
							it as a strategy? Are the narratives broadly
							accessible? How can I plan to benefit from another’s
							experience? Are there ways to plan rather than
							intend in more complex story structures? Are there
							formulas to convey narratives outside of tropes and
							universal heroes? How can we create fresh voices and
							build on them?
							<br />
							<br />
							While some of my classmates’ had user tests, I began
							to implement the same concept for feedback. I
							planned a question control sheet to guide the
							interviews and better answer the questions I was
							generating. Some of the questions included were:
							<br />Do the ideas resonate? <br />Are they clear?
							<br />Do the photos depict the themes? <br />What
							would make this more accessible? <br />What is a
							qusetion I should be asking?
							<br />

							The biggest impact on my project based on the
							interviews was feedback from a book designer. A
							significant portion of the interview delved into the
							conceptual aspects of the project revolved around
							history and intention. The parts of the discussion
							which dealt with the tangible design had to do with
							typographical communication and layout. Based upon
							these insights I took apart a lot of the layouts to
							simplify them. My intent had been to capture
							attention initially with an arresting title page
							layout. We decided they had been too distracting,
							and the payoff wasn’t fair. She really helped
							solidify my decisions and why I was making them.
							<br />
							<br />
							With the steady support of my teacher and my
							classmates, I was able to get back on track when the
							momentum was lost in the questions. I think the
							questions were a very important part of growing my
							work even though at times they were cause for
							paralysis. In the future, with bigger creative
							projects, I will have a written "spine" as Twyla
							Tharp calls it. A place to continually return to
							when comparing and contrasting new developments in
							my process. A written piece that provides a stronger
							cornerstone of intent. I had this with the written
							themes that I refered back to but next time I may
							try for more simple and direct backbone.
							<br />
							<br />
							Working with this project and process taught me so
							much. Even though it is my ambition to eventually
							speak well to a wide audience, I may have to start
							with smaller focused groups first. Gathering for a
							wide reaching narrative is casting too wide a net.
							Understanding value in a smaller community first and
							the conversation it generates would push the work
							more poignantly. I do think there are some answers
							for speaking to a broader audience with basic human
							tropes. But the development comes in the nuance.
							This has been a big process building experience for
							me. I understand better how to add guardrails to my
							work and decipher if something is an effective
							detour. I plan to evolve ideas of narrative strategy
							through more process and work.
